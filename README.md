# AirBnb Experience page clone.

![The home view](./public/airbnb.png)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
After a period of setbacks, I had gone back to learning React! This is a project from Bob Ziroll's scrimba course, it has helped me a lot to refresh my knowledge of react (props, conditional rendering, mimicking data gotten from api), as it gave me room to try out building this myself! It is a clone of the AirBnb experience page, it took the project a bit further to make it responsive on all screen sizes.

## How To Run? ðŸ¤”
Download this code either as a `zip file` or use the `git clone` command to clone it.
Then, open the project folder in your editor and on the integrated terminal:

After the installation,
- Run `npm start` to run the project on your browser localhost.
    That's all you'd need to do ðŸ™‚
